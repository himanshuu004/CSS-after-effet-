 I discovered a super cool trick with CSS to create an interactive hover effect using the ::after pseudo-element! 🎨 Here's how it works:

💻 Code Breakdown:

The button starts with a sleek, minimal design 💠 with a cyan border and text.
The magic happens when you hover over the button 🖱️: a circle animation (created using the ::after pseudo-element) scales up, filling the button with a smooth background transition 🎯.
The text color changes 🖤 as the circle expands, giving a dynamic, responsive feel to the button!
🔥 Why It’s Awesome: This effect brings your buttons to life ⚡—without any JavaScript! It adds a clean, responsive interaction ✨, improving the user experience and making your UI more engaging. 🚀
